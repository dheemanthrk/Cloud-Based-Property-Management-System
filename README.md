# 🏢 Cloud-Based Property Management System

**`Serverless Data Processing | Dalhousie University | May 2024 – June 2024`**  
**Supervised by:** Prof. Saurabh Dey

A secure and scalable cloud-native property management system developed as a **final project** for the **Serverless Data Processing** course at **Dalhousie University**. Built with a **React** frontend, it leverages **AWS services** for authentication, data management, and automation to ensure seamless and efficient operations.
